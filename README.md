# Dmemmove

This is part of my [Google Summer of Code project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6103365956665344/#5475582328963072), _Independency of D from the C Standard Library_.

It is a public repository for the work on the `memmove()` replacement.

## Compile and Run
`dmd bench.d Dmemmove.d -O -inline -mcpu=avx && ./bench average` (DMD - Optimized and Inlined)

## Contact / Feedback
An important reason that I published it so early (about 5 days of work) is to get feedback on different machines,
from different people. <br/>
So, if you are interested in helping, it would be beneficial to do one or more of the following:
  - Test in DMD.
  - Test on Windows or Linux.

See above for compilation and run instructions.
Then just send me the results and your CPU model.

If you are involved in D, you can also ping me on Slack (Stefanos Baziotis), or post in the dlang forum thread above.
